# Me in Markdown

## Introduction

My name is Gia and I am 15 years old. I am in tenth grade and I do not really like it so far. I am not easily motivated, so I am scared this school year will be hard for me. But I am going to try to make the most of it. I was also on the girls basketball team last year. I did enjoy my time on the team, but ultimately decided that it wasn't for me. I hope I can find something else to do to be a part of the school. I have actually had my eye on yearbook for next year's elective.

Some things I enjoy or like to do include biking, reading, watching TV, and DIY crafts. I DIY my own earrings and sometimes make them as a gift to friends. I really like reading, too. I have probably read 6-7 books this year alone. Most of them are true crime novels and realistic fiction books. My favorite TV show of all time is F.R.I.E.N.D.S! I have watched the whole show 4 times over and I never get tired of it. Lastly, I enjoy biking probably most of all. It feels so amazing to be free on a bike and ride wherever you want to go. I usually ride bikes with my best friend and we play music on a speaker as we ride. It has to be one of the top ten best feelings in the world.

My most memorable summer was about 2 years ago. I went to Maui with my family for the first time and I loved it. We did all the tourist activities that you can think of. I loved the nature, the weather, and the food. It was the most memorable though, because of a trip down the Road to Hana. While visiting a waterfall, I slipped and fell and hit my chin on a sharp rock! It was terrible and I had to go to the hospital to get stitches, thirteen to be exact. It was weird to get injured on vacation. But don't worry, I still had fun on the last two days. However, my accident was interesting because I actually didn't know the severity of my fall until I looked down and saw the blood on my white shirt. I thought that I was fine! So I guess that says something about me.
