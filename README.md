## Introduction

My name is Gia and I am 15 years old. I am in tenth grade and I do not really like it so far. 

Some things I enjoy or like to do include biking, reading, watching TV, and DIY crafts. I DIY my own earrings and sometimes make them to gift to friends. I really like reading, too. I have probably read 6-7 books this year alone. Most of them are true crime novels and realistic fiction books. My favorite TV show of all time is F.R.I.E.N.D.S! I have watched the whole show 4 times over and I never get tired of it.
